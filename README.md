2. Description


This website, dedicated to the 30 Minute Film Festival (30MFF), was conceived and brought to life by me, Gunjan, a student of the Communications Lab (IM-UH 1011) at New York University, Abu Dhabi. The challenge set before us was to conceptualize, film, and present a video with a coherent narrative and a resonating message – something more profound than a random assortment of scenes.

Inspired by this challenge, I crafted a unique narrative featuring soft toys as student surrogates within the university environment. This video embarks on an engaging visual odyssey, scrutinizing the reciprocal relationship between students and the green surroundings integral to the university campus. It paints a vivid picture of the paramount role green spaces play in cultivating a serene, positive, and conducive environment – subtly positioning nature as the unsung catalyst within the university's microcosm. The video weaves a captivating tale about life on a verdant campus, encapsulating the serene influence that nature wields over our lives. It unveils a unique standpoint, emphasizing that the greenery on campus is not merely an aesthetic element but plays a pivotal role in mitigating stress levels among students. By nurturing mental well-being and subsequently amplifying academic performance, nature emerges as a key player in student life.

To house this enlightening film, I embarked on creating a website. Leveraging the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I sought to construct a platform that encapsulates the essence of our video effectively. This required me to ensure that the design, interface, and overall functionality of the site mirrored the story, message, and ambiance of our video, thereby providing a unified and enriching user experience.

3.1 Story

The narrative of the video centers around four friends, each with their distinct academic journeys. Two of them find themselves confined to their rooms, struggling with their inability to concentrate on their studies. As their exams loom on the horizon, a palpable sense of stress permeates their lives. The four walls of their room, instead of offering an environment of focus, serve as a breeding ground for distraction. They often find themselves drawn to the television, succumbing to a cycle of distraction that invariably leads to subpar academic performance.

In contrast, the other two friends have chosen nature as their study sanctuary. Immersed in the soothing embrace of the outdoors, they are seemingly untouched by stress. Their academic results tell a compelling story – their marks reflect the effectiveness of their tranquil study setting.
Witnessing the contrasting experiences of their friends, the indoor study pair decide to venture out of their rooms and into the openness of nature. The foursome eventually unite in their newfound common study space amidst greenery. This shared academic journey in the lap of nature yields positive results for all - their grades improve significantly.

The video encapsulates a potent moral – nature serves as a powerful antidote to stress and a catalyst for happiness. Studying amidst greenery enhances focus and productivity, thereby significantly improving academic performance. It is a testament to the profound influence of our environment on our mental state and overall productivity.

3.2 Recording and Editing

The filming process spanned a concise duration of approximately 15 minutes. The chosen locations were the lounge of the A2C building and a common space situated on the second floor of New York University, Abu Dhabi. We employed a variety of camera angles to capture the scenes, lending visual depth and dimension to the narrative.
Once the video was captured, the footage was transported into iMovie for a thorough editing process. A compilation of diverse short clips was merged into a cohesive single film, thereby creating a fluid and continuous storyline. Several transition effects were integrated into the video, coupled with textual overlays to enhance the narrative's impact. To further augment the emotive resonance of the video, I carefully curated and incorporated music that aligned with the evolving situations and emotions depicted.
The end product of this meticulously executed process is a visually captivating video that not only spotlights the breathtaking beauty of its settings but also effectively demonstrates the intricate technical expertise involved in the art of video creation.

4. Website Design and Interaction


The journey of conceptualizing, designing, and implementing the website was an intricate process encompassing several critical stages. This involved the initial crafting of wireframes, strategizing and refining user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) elements, culminating in the actual coding and development of the final website.

4.1 Wireframe
The wireframing process began as a hand-drawn blueprint on paper, initially encompassing four distinct pages: home, about me, projects, and contact. However, due to time constraints, the final website iteration saw a slight alteration with the exclusion of the 'about me' page, resulting in a more streamlined three-page design. 

4.2 Design and Interactivity of Website
Designing and infusing interactivity into the website was a process of gradual learning and implementation. It began with me immersing myself in instructional videos on YouTube, learning how to incorporate various elements into the website. The HTML and CSS documentation served as a substantial guiding resource throughout this phase.

The first step involved setting a background image for the webpage that deeply resonated with the video's theme. Following this, a logo that echoed the video's narrative was introduced, significantly enhancing the site's visual appeal.

Next, a navigation bar was developed to facilitate user navigation between the various sections of the website. To inject an additional layer of interest and relevance, a link to an article closely related to the video's content was integrated.   

The second page was dedicated to housing the video itself and a comprehensive description accompanying it. Plans to incorporate 'share', 'save for later', and 'download' buttons were initially conceived, but due to time constraints and the complexity of JavaScript involved, these features couldn't be implemented.
The final page was designed as a personal corner, offering insights about me. This section was enlivened by including my social media handles and a contact form, allowing users to connect with me directly. Despite the time constraints, the process was a substantial learning experience that led to the creation of an engaging, user-friendly website.
